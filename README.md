# cocoscreator-html5-test
# Before Reading and Using
This HTML loader was from another Cocos Creator HTML5 game, and I suggest you not publicly hosting any Cocos Creator Application ported with this method. You should only use this HTML file to play Cocos Creator games on your PC, to avoid lawsuits from game developers. 
# What the hell is this?
A loader of Cocos Creator application in HTML5, located at http://sxiao.4399.com/4399swf/upload_swf/ftp32/liuxinyu/20200414/5/gameIndex.html

Please note that this is just a temporarily solution on porting Cocos Creator Applications, I haven't tested it on any of the apks created with Cocos Creator yet. 
# Okay, so how can I use this?
Copy it into the "assets" folder, build a localhost, enjoy!
